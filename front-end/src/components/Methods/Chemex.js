                                <p>The Chemex Coffeemaker was invented in 1941 by Dr. 
                                    Peter Schlumbohm PhD. Made simply from non-porous, 
                                    borosilicate glass, it brews coffee without imparting any 
                                    flavors of its own. On permanent display at MOMA New York 
                                    and other fine museums, it is truly a work of art.</p>

                                    <p>The Chemex consists of an narrow-waist glass flask and 
                                        uses proprietary paper filters, made of chemically 
                                        bonded paper (of thicker-gauge paper than the standard 
                                        paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker).</p>

                            <p>For best results, we strongly recommend starting with whole 
                                bean coffee and grinding with a burr grinder immediately 
                                before brewing. If you grind your coffee too soon, it will 
                                quickly lose many of the compounds that give it such delightful 
                                aromas and flavors.</p>

                                <p>While it may seem complicated, we think using a scale actually 
                                    makes brewing easier by taking any guesswork out of the equation.</p>
