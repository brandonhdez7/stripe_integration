                                <p>In Italy a Caffè Moka is quite different from, say, 
                                    calling for a Mocha coffee in America. To sound 
                                    alike is not to taste alike, coffee-style. 
                                    For making moka, the chocolate syrup is nowhere in sight.</p>

                                    <p>Small, two-chambered moka pots sit on many Italian stovetops, 
                                        easy to use and producing a full-bodied coffee, rich in aroma. 
                                        Many have an hourglass shape, but you can find moka pots in a 
                                        variety of styles, all based on the same operating principle. 
                                        Water is heated in a lower chamber. Vapor pressure approaching 
                                        two atmospheres pushes the water up through ground coffee in a 
                                        filter, which collects in the upper chamber as liquid coffee.</p>

                            <p>Moka pots were invented in 1930s Italy. The name 
                                refers to the city of Mocha, Yemen, for many 
                                centuries a center of coffee excellence.</p>

                                <p>Every moka pot consists of a cylinder 
                                    (bottom chamber), a filter funnel, a 
                                    collector (top chamber) with a second 
                                    removable filter, held in place by a rubber gasket. 
                                    The seal and removable filter should be changed periodically.</p>
